# Command-Prompt-In-Batch
For use on systems that disable command prompt via reg/gp edit

Functions nearly the same as simply running cmd.exe

# Warning
Although it *should* work, I do **NOT** recommend running any sensitive actions this way, as there may be some bugs I do not know about. ***I am not liable for the program not doing exactly what you want!!***, those are ***your own*** risks.

# Use
Simply download and run the .cmd file, you can rename it to .bat if you wish for whatever reason.

# Issues
CTRL-C cannot be hooked/blocked, so CTRL-C will cause a pause, pressing it twice will skip this warning, but may close the prompt at times, recommended solution is responding n.
