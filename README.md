# Command-Prompt-In-Batch
For use on systems that disable command prompt via reg/gp edit
Functions nearly the same as simply running cmd.exe

# Use
Simply download and run the .cmd file, you can rename it to .bat if you wish for whatever reason.

# Issues
CTRL-C cannot be hooked/blocked, so CTRL-C will cause a pause, pressing it twice will skip this warning, but may close the prompt at times, recommended solution is responding n.
